The dataset containing demonstration and experiments results from our ICRA 24 submission D^3Field: Dynamic 3D Descriptor Fields for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation. It contains four RGBD observations and end-effector poses. Experiments are run on Kinova Gen3 robot and the target tasks are generalizable robotic manipulation conditioned on 2D goal image, including organizing utensils, organizing office desk, and so on.
